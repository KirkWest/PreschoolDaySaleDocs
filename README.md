### - Purpose

### - Functionality / features

- Login as user or admin, both will require authentication to access.
- Create new user in the database that has to be reviewed by admin, this contains information on the days you currently go, the room your child is in, and also the parents information.
- Buy page with a calendar, the calendar will have a buy button on days that are for sale that will display the room that is for sale but no further information for provicy reasons. This button when clicked will remove the buy option and send an email to admin with the what user has bought this day for them to process.
- Display page with the ability to sell your available days (this info will be different depending on the user logged in) your days will have a sell button that removes the day and sends an email to admin to process.


### - Target audience

The target audience for the app is both Early childhood centres as well as the parents of children at these services. Whilst this app will be personalised to ACELP, it could be used by any early education centre with some customisation to the front end design.
